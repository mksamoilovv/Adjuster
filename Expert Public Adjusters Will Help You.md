## 🔍 [Understanding the Role of Insurance Adjusters in the Claims Process](https://bit.ly/public-adjuster)

Insurance adjusters act as intermediaries between you and the insurance company, determining the payout you receive for your claim. But not all adjusters are created equal. **Independent insurance adjusters** are hired by the insurance company, while **public adjusters** work for you, the policyholder.

- **Independent Adjusters**: Appointed by insurance companies to assess damages and provide impartial evaluations. Their allegiance, however, is with the insurer.
- **Public Adjusters**: Work exclusively for policyholders, advocating for your best interests to secure a more favorable settlement.
